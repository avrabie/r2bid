Next Steps
Initialize the Project:

In IntelliJ, create a new Spring Boot project.
Add Spring WebFlux, R2DBC, Kafka, and any other dependencies (e.g., PostgreSQL).
Use JDK 21 for full compatibility with Project Loom.
Set Up Kafka:

For now, you can run Kafka locally using Docker to get things rolling. Later, you can scale this out.
Configure Kafka Producer to simulate stock price data.
Create the Stock Price Consumer:

Build a Spring WebFlux consumer service that receives stock data from Kafka and uses SSE to push updates to the frontend.
Store the stock prices in PostgreSQL using R2DBC for asynchronous database interactions.
Bidding Mechanism:

Plan a simple auction-style bidding system. For now, you could model bidding on stock pricesâ€”where users can place bids for specific stocks, and you can track the highest bid in real-time.
Use WebFlux to handle real-time bid updates and changes.
Build Out the UI:

Use React + Tailwind for the real-time stock prices and bidding interface.
Show stock prices with bid updates, using SSE to keep the UI fresh.
